          Thank you for the submission. However, the goal of our journal is to
          publish work outside of people's primary genre (<a
            href="https://www.genre2.org/submit.html"
            >https://www.genre2.org/submit.html</a
          >) so we can't consider this. If you'd like to send us work outside of
          your primary genre we'd be happy to check it out. <br /><br />Warm
          regards,
          <br />

          Thank you for your interest in genre2. We appreciate the chance to
          consider your work; unfortunately, we were unable to find a place for
          it in our upcoming issue. Please do keep us in mind for future work.
          <br />

          Best,<br />
