      Thank you for the submission. However, the goal of our journal is to
      publish work outside of people's primary genre (<a
        href="https://www.genre2.org/submit.html"
        >https://www.genre2.org/submit.html</a
      >) so we can't consider this. If you'd like to send us work outside of
      your primary genre we'd be happy to check it out. <br /><br />Warm
      regards,
      <br />

      Thank you for your interest in genre2. We appreciate the chance to
      consider your work; unfortunately, we were unable to find a place for it
      in our upcoming issue. Please do keep us in mind for future work. <br />

      Best,<br />
